# Econometrics I (Part I) @ FGV - 2025
This is the repo for the first half of the Econometrics I, taught by [Raul Riva](https://rgriva.github.io/). The second part will be taught by [Andrea Flores](https://www.afloresm.com/home).

* Instructor: Raul Guarini Riva (raul.riva at fgv.br)
* TA: Taric Latif (tariclatif at gmail.com)
* Classes: Tuesdays and Thursdays, 9:00-11:00

## Why Should You Take This Class?
First of all, it's a mandatory class. But let's set that aside...

Most of you will be doing empirical work very soon. This class will cover topics that are useful for applied work in several fields like Labor Economics, Development Economics, Urban Economics, Finance, Health Economics, etc. After learning the basics in a cross-sectional environment, we will tap into other data structures like *Time Series* and *Panel Data*. Both are ubiquotous in applied work, nowadays. Mastering the topics in this class will help you hit the ground running with empirical work in the next quarters.

I have four broad learning goals for this first half of the class. Ideally, after Week 5, you would be able to:

- Understand the motivation and implementation of standard non-parametric Kernel-based methods;
- Understand the mean idea behind Bootstrap methods for i.i.d. data and its implementation;
- Deal with time series data, understand concepts like persistence and autocorrelation, estimate ARMA models, and estimate a VAR etc;
- Implement GMM estimation under a general heterokedasticity and autocorrelation structure (very useful for panel methods!);

## Topics
A very tentative schedule below:

(In construction)

| Week | Tentative Schedule                |
|------|--------------------------------------------|
|Week 1    | Non-parametric estimation + (i.i.d.) Bootstrap|
|Week 2    |abc|
|Week 3    |abc|
|Week 4    |abc|
|Week 5    |abc|

## Books? Slides?

I will prepare slides for each lecture and, ideally, I will make them available to you before class (maybe _just before_ class). Lecture slides will be uploaded to this repo under ```lectures```. The slides will have content mainly from two different books:

- [Econometrics](https://www.amazon.com/Econometrics-Bruce-Hansen/dp/0691235899), by Bruce Hansen;
- [Time Series Analysis](https://www.amazon.com/Time-Analysis-James-Douglas-Hamilton/dp/0691042896), by James Hamilton;

I will highlight, for each lecture, what the relevant chapters are. I stress that **reading a textbook is mandatory -- you should not rely only on slides**. There is only so much we can cover during class time and through slides.

## Administrative Stuff

### Office Hours

I try to have all my meetings on **Fridays**. I will reserve the **9am-10am** slot for general office hours, but we can also schedule another time by email if that time does not work for you. I am always happy to meet to talk about the material.

Taric will host weekly sessions with you as well. He has full discretion regarding how to use that time. If you want a specific type of TA session, please negotiate it directly with him. My experience as a TA tells me that the best usage of TA session time is going through common mistakes on the problem sets, talking about specific issues that came up during your own study time, and doing extra problems.

It is good etiquette to email the TA beforehand and let him know about your super specific doubts beforehand. I strongly suggest you email Taric about anything that is unclear regarding the class-time material and you'd like to see covered during the TA session time.

### Attendance

There are good and bad news here:
 - **Good news**: attendance is not mandatory at all. In any case, I like to believe I will be able to add value to your learning experience. Hence, I suggest you come. But there will be absolutely no retaliation if you choose not to -- I mean it.
 - **Bad news**: if you decide to come, you _have_ to be on time. There is a 10-minute grace period. I reserve myself the right to deny your entry after that, unless you have an extremely good reason to be late, or let me know in advance that you will be late.

## Evaluation

 - There will be **two problem sets** and **one exam** for this first half of the class;
 - These three pieces of evaluation will be graded out of 10. Your grade for the first half of the class will be a weighted average of these three grades out of 10: 1/6 * (grade on problem set 1) + 1/6 * (grade on problem set 2) + 2/3 * (grade on the exam);
 - The exam will be in-person and individual. I will make sure you have enough time for the exam. I do not want you to be time-constrained;
 - Every student is allowed to bring *one A4-sized sheet with notes, on both sides*. You cannot share notes during the exam, but you can bring anything written on your sheet.

## Problem Set Logistics

- You should form groups of _up to_ 3 people. You should keep the same group throughout the first half of the class. Andrea will left divorce and remarriage happen at the second half.
- You should create a folder for your group under ```student_work```. The name of your directory should be ```name1_name2_name3```. For instance, if your group is composed by Alice, Bob, and Charlie, you should create a folder called ```alice_bob_charlie```. Each of these folders should contain subdirectories for the different problem sets. For instance, ```alice_bob_charlie/ps1```, ```alice_bob_charlie/ps2```, ...
- The problem sets will have both theoretical questions and empirical questions. You need to submit _a pdf report_ answering both the theoretical part and the coding part. You do not need to include any code in this report.
- You can use any reasonable languages to solve the empirical parts, as long as it does not come with pre-made routines. For example: Python, R, Matlab, Julia, even C of Fortran if you are a very hardcore person. No, you cannot use Stata and you cannot use pre-packaged routines. For example, if you are solving something with the GMM estimator, I do not want you using the ```gmm``` package in R. Just be reasonable.
- Submit code and your pdf reports as separate files. Add as many figures and tables to your report as you deem necessary to answer the empirical part.

## Ongoing Feedback

**This is really important**:

- This is the first time I will be teaching this class. The end goal is making _your_ learning path easier;
- I need ongoing feedback, and you do not need to be shy. If there is something I do that makes the lectures worse, please tell me. If there is anything you like a lot, please tell me.
- Feel free to email me, and talk to me in person. Feedback, even if super negative, will **not** impact your grade, obviously.
