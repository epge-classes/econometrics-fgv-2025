# 📘 Onboarding Instructions for PhD Econometrics I 2025 - Part I 

Welcome to the course! We will use **GitHub** for distributing lecture notes, data, and problem sets, and for collecting your group submissions.

Follow these steps carefully to set up your GitHub account and connect to the class.

The coolest part: this file was fully generated by AI! 😎

---

## 1. Create a GitHub Account
If you don’t already have one:

1. Go to [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join).
2. Sign up with your **real name** and your university email if possible.
3. Choose a username you’re comfortable being identified with (this will show up in group repos).
4. Verify your email.

---

## 2. Join the Course on GitHub Classroom
Each problem set will have its own link. This link will take you to GitHub Classroom. That will create a private repository for your group to submit your work.

The first assignment is just to set up the system.


1. Open the course invite link:  👉 **[https://classroom.github.com/a/S3UbgLHv](https://classroom.github.com/a/S3UbgLHv)**
2. Sign in with your GitHub account.
3. You will see the course **roster** (list of student names).  
   - Select your **own name** to link your GitHub account to the roster.  
   - This is important — it ensures your submissions are correctly tied to you.

---

## 3. Join or Create Your Group
- For group assignments, you will be asked to either:
  - **Create a new group** (choose a short name, e.g. `Team-Keynes`), or
  - **Join your group’s repo** if another member has already created it.
- Groups must remain the same throughout the first part of the class.  
- Only one repo per group, per problem set, will exist, which is shared by all group members.
- Only group members can see and edit the repo.

The TA and myself have access to all group repos for grading.

---

## 4. Access Course Materials
- The master course repository is here:  👉 **[https://github.com/epge-classes/econometrics-fgv-2025](https://github.com/epge-classes/econometrics-fgv-2025)**
- This repo contains:
  - 📄 Lecture notes  
  - 📊 Data for problem sets  
  - 📝 Problem set PDFs  

You will **not submit work** in this repo — it is only for downloading materials.

---

## 5. Submit Assignments
1. When a new problem set is released, you will receive a Classroom link.
2. Accept the assignment as a group (or join your existing group).
3. GitHub Classroom will create a **private empty repository** for your group.
   - Example: `phd-econometrics-2025-problem-set-1-team-keynes`
4. Clone your group repo to your computer:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/epge-classes/phd-econometrics-2025-problem-set-1-team-keynes.git
   ```
5. Download the PDF for the problem set + data from the **master repo**.
6. Work on the problem set locally, then commit and push your solutions (code, writeup, etc.) to your **group repo**.

---

## 6. Grading
- Only your **group repo** will be graded.
- Make sure all files you want graded are committed and pushed before the deadline.
- Each member’s GitHub contributions are visible to the instructor.

---

## 7. Basic Git Commands
Here are the most common commands you’ll use inside your group repo folder:
```bash
# Copy your group's repo to your computer
git clone <repo-url>

# Check the status of your changes
git status

# Stage changes when you want to commit
git add <filename>

# Commit changes with a message
git commit -m "Finished question 2"

# Push changes to GitHub (which means you are sending it to GitHub)
git push
```

---

✅ That’s it! If you run into trouble:
- Make sure your GitHub account is verified.
- Double-check you selected your **own name** when linking to the roster.
- Ask your group members or contact the TA if you get stuck.
